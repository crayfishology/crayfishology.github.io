## About This Site

While I was reading and scanning over different articles or books, no matter how much inspiration I received, my impression would vanish sooner or later if I didn't take any note. Therefore, I utilize this blog to mainly fossilize reactions to and memory of certain sources that I found awe-inspiring. I also would include some practicum I've done that is necessary for learning specific knowledge and comment on it.
