In his book *[Graduate Student Survival Guide](https://www.douban.com/book/subject/27108502/)*, Prof. M. H. Perng mentions an anecdote where a pure mathematics paper could have decided the winner of the Space Race. I found this story quite thought-provoking, and I want to share with you, the reader of my first post.

During the 60s, USSR was running ahead of the US by successfully launching Mr. Yuri Gagarin into space and safely retrieved him. Consequently, President John F. Kennedy announced that he would pour more funding into space projects. Although many Americans were not confident about their chance to catch up, the US astonishingly accomplished the lunar mission in 1969, and hence secured its leading position. 

Did the geniuses from USSR collectively have a brain fog? It's the opposite instead. For instance, a key control theory was needed to compute the rocket pathway that optimizes fuel consumption. The USSR government asked its scientists to come up with the formula from scratch. They diligently worked through the mathematical formula, and worked out an useful model circa 1960. However, the scientists found out later that, the same key mathematical idea was already mentioned in a pure math paper written by an American math professor way back in 1939. Had they read about that paper, their work would have progressed a lot faster. 

The US scientists, instead of working everything from scratch, got help from ingenuity of others. Starting from 1961, *International Aerospace Abstract* was serialized, covering original and translated abstract of research papers, conferences, and proceedings all around the world that are related to aerospace engineering. Additionally, NASA started to publish *Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports*, which served as a citation index for the scientists. All these effort were made so buried knowledge could see light of the day. The scientists and aerospace engineers then proceeded with their projects in a heretorfore unimagined way. Prof. Perng considers this undertaking of extracting knowledge across time and space "exists for those who are in need" is the key for US's leading place in the Space Race. 

After reading about this curious event, I did a couple of straightforward searches and found a more elaborate account in an applied math journal, written by two professors in Germany back in 2009 [1]. The aforementioned pure math paper was authored by Edward James McShane [2], in which he proved a more general Lagrange multiplier rule, and "he could not suspect how important this would become later in the theory of optimal control". The soviet group, led by accomplished mathematician Lev Pontryagin, found this article only after they spent years to tackle the problem comprehensively, and proved what now known as the Pontryagin's maximum principle. To be fair, McShane's work only covered part of the things to be taken care of in the fuel optimization pathway problem, but it was a key concept which could have greatly accelerated the progress. After all, Pontryagin and his students worked on this problem starting from zero. 

The discovery of this paper sadly stayed as lost potential. McShane later became aware of this incident and wrote: "The research ... was a part of pure mathematics and, in contrast, the development in optimal control emerged from practical applications. In pure mathematics, questions have been answered that nobody has posed". 

Prof. Perng uses this anecdote to emphasize the seriousness of widely reading literature reviews. I am not sure in which degree available citation index contributed to the US winning the Space Race, as there are other major factors, such as USSR's unbalanced emphasis on military expenditure, which had a great impact on its economic growth. However, I still find this story awe-inspiring. 

When I was trying to navigate through the science of life during my undergrad, I was confounded by its vast knowledge domain. Biology as a science is not so unified as a whole; instead, different area of study are like isolated islands. Sure, there are concepts like the central dogma of biology, the information transition from DNA to RNA to protein, being the core underlying all subfields; but when you go deeper into various subjects, the details of specific mechanisms alone would take most of the time. A dedicated scholar would possibly spend his or her best years scrutinizing the same single protein, and by no means this doesn't require talent, creativity, or continuous endeavor, but the limited scope of an accomplished scholar is not advantageous. 

Now we are moving into a new era of biology utilizing the massive sequencing of omics data (DNA sequencing, RNA transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.). Indeed, data has become essential in state-of-art biology researches: "A first step in these research practices is often to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for data sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of experimental datasets" [3]. At the same time, tons of data as well as their throughput analysis are being generated every day, by countless sequencing machines in labs around the world. An omnipresent protocol of data is available for biology, and they are, in a way, a more universal language of the subject. However, the "islands" stay isolated: many sequencing data are generated for a single-time analysis of a unique mechanism, and then they are archived, either sometimes used in some sort of meta-anaylsis or just completely forgotten, without even being curated properly. There is a hidden mine of bio data out there, yet to be analyzed in a more effective way. 

Today, researchers generally don't face the same challenge scientists encountered back in 1950s; you can simply google up all the related literature reviews about the question you care about. However, the need to integrate differential approaches is getting more serious. "From the perspective of engineers or physicists, the preoccupation with molecular details involves a risk of missing out on dynamic patterns that could be captured with more generic models. experimentalists, in contrast, may find that such generic models often lack specificity or merely reproduce current biological knowledge" [3] Integrating data-friendly modeling with less resolution and experiments with limited scope remains a challenge. They are like isolated islands of knowledge, yet to be connected by a bridge. And to bridge such concepts, one needs a compendious study of both fields. One may take decades of painstaking training in gaining helpful insight, but the bridging of both is predictably fruitful and worth pursuing for life. 

When we talk about unity, math again comes into play, because of its universaility and pureness. Therefore, I believe there are still hidden principles in the logical world of math that can help this problem, especially with powerful computational force today. It's not just how fields like biology look for whatever they prefer in the armamentarium of math, such as graphical models; it's about completely changing the mode of thinking and approaches to questions, directing and influencing how one would alter the design of experiments and improve plans of attack.



I shall end this post by a quote I found in "[A Super Brief Introduction of Modern Math](http://www.penglixun.com/study/science/mit_math_system.html)" by Dahua Lin: (translated)

- My previous mathematical knowledge and skills were severely insufficient to dive deeply into the questions I care about
- There are concepts and tools buried in math that are very suitable for solving these questions, and they are just generally not scrutinized enough by researchers in applied science
- Therefore, I determined to dive into the vast ocean of mathematics, and hopefully when I get ashore, I will have sufficiently powerful tools to face these questions.
