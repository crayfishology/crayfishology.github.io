# A Missing Paper



In his book "[Graduate Student Survival Guide](https://www.douban.com/book/subject/27108502/)", Prof. M. H. Perng mentions an instance in the Space Race where a pure math paper greatly advanced the aerospace development progress and in some way decides the winner of the Space Race. I found this event quite inspiring, and I want to share with you, the reader of my first post.

During the 60s, USSR was running ahead of the US by successfully launching Mr. Yuri Gagarin into space and safely retreived him. In response to the [fallback], President John F Kennedy announced he would pour more funding into the project. Although many of the American citizens were not confident about their winning chance, the US [surprisingly] managed to land the moon in 1969 and hence [fortify] its winning place. It turns out that sole funding could not help the US progress this fast. For the calculation of such 



[not so pleasantly], I attempted to find the aforementioned pure math paper in 1939, but failed [miserably]; neither did I find credible sources slightly related to the whole account. Therefore, the whole event might possibly be, unfortunately, Prof. M. H. Perng's vivid fabrication in order to illustrate his emphasis on the importance of voraciously reading literature review. However, I still find this story quite inspiring. 

During the last few semesters of my B.S. in biological science, I found the lack of mathematical and logical building in my curriculum concerning , and shift my 



argues for importance of scanning large amount of literature reviews.

Soviet-US race, JFK announcing fund adding, but in the end it turns out to be: a math modeling found in 1939



I didn’t’ find it,





Metadata analysis. The ethics issue it brings, how we can integrate modeling and experimentalist approach more effectively, this is something worth pursing for life, either from reading, actually building models myself, replicating experiments, research & development. 



As I was reading, 

1.  A first step in these [systems biology and synthetic biology] research practices is often to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for data sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of experimental datasets (Leonelli 2016).
2. 
3. 
4. Philosophyical applied and basic science

Structure and curate data, in order to find that "missing paper". And for sure, also actively partcipate in the grandeur exploration of science of life. The complex study is such a great place for that: economics, physics, much of the same data behavior in which you can communicate with experts across myriads of fields.
